    <!- Try building a new body here, bootstrap is a wise choice ->
    <div class="px-5 py-5 mx-auto">
        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Our Plan</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">We will make a website with the intention of showing the profiles of the most iconic players in sports</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- should have a list of sports (drop down menu)</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- Drop down menu shows a list of sports, you can choose which one you go to</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- pages should have a menu where you can click on an iconic player (both current and past)</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- each profile will have career stats, teams, and iconic moments (photos and videos)</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- In addition, we can add a brief biography about the player. </p>
